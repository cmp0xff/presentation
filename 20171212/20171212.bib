  title     = {The integrable cosmological model with scalar field and its extension to PT-symmetric theory},

  year      = {2016},
  abstract  = {Integrable model of cosmology with scalar fields of two types is considered. It could be able to describe inflation and post-inflation in evolution of the Universe including period with equation of state by phantom type. The model includes a kinetic term which is mixing scalar fields and resulting in an integrable case. The exact solutions are found for both classic and quantum cases for the Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric. It is suggested an extension of the sector of scalar matter by complex potentials which are preserving PT symmetry in classic and quantum models. },

  abstract  = {We show that in a sense of distributions \[\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0+} {1\over \pi^2} \tau\sinh\pi\tau \int_{\varepsilon}^{\infty} K_{i\tau}(y)K_{ix}(y){dy\over y} =\delta(\tau-x),\] where \(\delta\) is the Dirac distribution, \(\tau\), \(x\in\mathbb{R}\) and \(K_{\nu}(x)\) is the modified Bessel function. The convergence is in \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R})\) for any even \(\varphi(x)\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R})\) being a restriction to \(\mathbb{R}\) of a function \(\varphi(z)\) analytic in a horizontal open strip \(G_a=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\colon\,|\text{Im}\,z|\lt a, \ a\gt 0\}\) and continuous in the strip closure. Moreover, it satisfies the condition \(\varphi(z)=O\bigl(|z|^{-\text{Im}\,z-\alpha}e^{-\pi|\text{Re}\,z|/2}\bigr)\), \(|\text{Re}\,z|\to\infty\), \(\alpha\gt 1\) uniformly in \(\overline{G_a}\). The result is applied to prove the representation theorem for the inverse Kontorovich-Lebedev transformation on distributions.},
